# Week7-Scrum
Scrum is a management framework that describes how teams can work together to develop a product.

## Day 1 - Overview of Scrum
How to work with agile, iterative software development using Scrum. We will look at why, what and how?

Make team contracts.

### Readings:
Pages (page numbers at the bottom of each page) 1-13 in https://www.infoq.com/minibooks/scrum-xp-from-the-trenches-2

### Exercises:
Establish team contract for Fog project

## Day 2 - User Stories and Product Backlog
How to define requirements as user stories and how to build a Product Backlog containing stories based on estimation and prioritization.

#### User story format
You can use this format for writing user stories: As a "type of user" , I want "some goal" so that "some reason"

The "I want ..." section is the important  to specify contents of the story.

#### Accept criteria
Accept criteria (also called "How to demo") are also part of writing a user story since they help define contents and scope of a story and will be used by a) team as guideline for story implemenation, b)  Product Owner at the end of a sprint when testing the story for "done".

### Story Workshop
Elephant Carpaccio exercise about dividing stories into tiny slices will be handed out in class.

## Day 3 Sprints and Sprint Backlog
How to do sprint planning, i.e. the planning of user stories for the next iteration.

#### Estimation
Stories must be estimated by the team. Planning poker is an agile estimating and planning technique that is consensus based. Use either values like S, M, L, XXXL (not estimable) or values like 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 20, 40 and 100. You can use app for this estimation activity or a deck of Planning Poker cards.  

#### The Sprint Backlog
In a sprint, highest priority stories are moved from Product Backlog to Sprint Backlog which is the Tea'ms own backlog. On a daily basis, team members move tasks from "Not check out" to "Checked out" to "Done". The team and Scrum master can monitor sprint progress  on Scrum Dash board and Burndown Chart.

### Exercises:
Unit testing with JUnit

Work on Product Backlog for Fog project + Team Contract

## Day 4 Scrum tools and work with Product Backlog
Introduction to Scrum tools + group work with identifying and writing  user stories for Product Backlog so they are ready for prioritization Friday. 

Use story template as specified for Day 2. Also remember to write acceptance criteria/how to demo! Remember to look at stories from user perspective when writing the stories. 

Remember the Triangle of Scope, Priority and Estimation. They all influence each other. You cannot estimate if you do not know the scope of a story (scope is derived from its description and acceptance criteria). The product owner cannot prioritize if he/she does not know the price (= estimation expressed in story points)
