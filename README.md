## Day 2 - User Stories and Product Backlog
How to define requirements as user stories and how to build a Product Backlog containing stories based on estimation and prioritization.

#### User story format
You can use this format for writing user stories: As a "type of user" , I want "some goal" so that "some reason"

The "I want ..." section is the important  to specify contents of the story.

#### Accept criteria
Accept criteria (also called "How to demo") are also part of writing a user story since they help define contents and scope of a story and will be used when Product Owner tests the story for "done".

## Day 3 Sprints and Sprint Backlog
How to do sprint planning, i.e. the planning of user stories for the next iteration.

Stories are broken into initial tasks and estimated. Planning poker is an agile estimating and planning technique that is consensus based. Use either S, M, L, XXXL or values like 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 20, 40 and 100. Use app for this or a deck of Planning Poker cards.  
#### The Sprint Backlog
